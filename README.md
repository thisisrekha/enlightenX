# EnlightenX  
**Empowering Vision through Deep Curve Estimation for Low-Light Mastery**  

EnlightenX is a deep learning-based solution for enhancing low-light images using the innovative Zero-DCE (Deep Curve Estimation) approach. This project provides a lightweight and real-time method for improving image visibility while preserving natural details and colors.  

## About Zero-DCE  
Zero-DCE introduces a self-supervised learning framework that focuses on:  
- **Illumination Smoothness:** Ensures visually consistent illumination across the image.  
- **Spatial Coherence:** Maintains the structural integrity of the image.  
- **Color and Exposure Balance:** Reduces distortions and ensures realistic color reproduction.
- 
## Features  
- **Real-Time Enhancement:** Processes low-light images quickly and efficiently.  
- **Custom Loss Functions:** Ensures spatial consistency, exposure balance, and color fidelity.  
- **Lightweight Model:** Optimized for deployment in resource-constrained environments.  

## Project Structure  
- Model architecture and training pipeline.  
- Custom loss functions for effective enhancement.  
- Real-time low-light image enhancement capabilities.

By combining these principles, Zero-DCE achieves natural and visually pleasing results for low-light image enhancement without the need for explicit ground truth references.  
  
## Tech Stack  
- **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras** for building and training the model  
- **NumPy**, **OpenCV** for data manipulation and image processing  
- **Matplotlib**, **PIL** for visualizing and saving images
